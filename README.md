# Varnish Test Bed

A set of tools for testing and configuring varnish. This can be particularly helpful if
you have a situation that is difficult to debug in production.

This testbed provides enough to get started with a simple backend (one or more) using
sinatra plus unicorn. It generates text HTML bodies with one or more esi includes that
also generate text. 

For my purposes, I introduced a random sleep in the esi requests to simplate a more
real-world situation where the body of the page is cached but the esi modules are not or
explicitly do not cache. 

This was originally created to test high context switching when multiple esi tags which
set the header

    Cache-Control: s-maxage=0

are inculded in high-traffic pages that are cached. To simulate this, you can request
/pages/i and observe the varnishlog for esi parsing or the request time when X-Cache denotes a HIT. 

# Getting started

    ./run-varnish /usr/sbin/varnishd 

    gem install unicorn 

    ruby -rubygems backend-server.rb  -p 8089
    # or 
    unicorn -c unicorn.conf -p 8089
    unicorn -c unicorn.conf -p 8090

    curl -I http://localhost:6083/

    for i in {1..1000}; do  echo "http://localhost:6083/pages/$i" >> urls.txt; done
    
    siege -i -f urls.txt -t 30S -c 20
